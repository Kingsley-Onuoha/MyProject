    <p>
      The US Department of Justice has released the highly anticipated affidavit
      behind this month’s search of<br />
      Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Florida estate home, confirming that the United
      States is investigating the<br />
      alleged mishandling of classified documents by the former US leader.<br />
      The redacted document released on Friday, August 26 provided more insight
      into the evidence that led the FBI <br />
      to carry out an unprecedented search of a former president's home on
      August 8.<br />
      Its release came after a federal judge on Thursday ordered the Department
      of Justice to release a redacted <br />
      version that had been submitted to the court.
