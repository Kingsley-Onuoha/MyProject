    <p>
      Actor Yul Edochie has dished out an advice to Nigerian youths over some of
      their activities online.<br />
      Edochie who stated that he has nothing against Nigerian youths, said
      insulting people every second won't get them where they should be.<br />
      The actor admitted that the government has not done well, but that there's
      so much youths can achieve if<br />
      they focus on self improvement.<br />
      He tweeted;<br />
      I have nothing against Nigerian youths. Just trying to wake them up.
      Catching cruise & insulting people every<br />
      second won't get you where you want to be. Yes the Govt hasn't done well
      but there's a lot you can achieve if you<br />
      focus on self improvement. Whatever you focus on grows.
