    <p>
      The Central Bank of Nigeria has released $265m to airlines operating in
      the country to settle outstanding <br />
      ticket sales<br />
      A breakdown of the figure shows $230 million was released as special FX
      intervention while another sum of<br />
      $35 million was released through Retail SMIS auction.<br />
      Confirming the release in a statement, the Director, Corporate
      Communications Department at the CBN, Mr. <br />
      Osita Nwanisobi said: "The Governor, Godwin Emefiele and his team were
      concerned about the development<br />
      and what it portends for the sector and travelers as well as the country
      in the comity of nations.<br />
      " He reiterated that the CBN was "not against any company repatriating its
      funds from the country, adding that<br />
      what the Bank stood for was an orderly exit for those that might be
      interested in doing so".<br />
      The CBN noted that with the release, it is expected that operators and
      travellers as well will heave a huge <br />sigh of relief as some airlines
      had threatened to withdraw their services in the face of unremitted funds
      for <br />
      outstanding sale of tickets.<br />
      Recall that Emirate Airlines announced on August 18 that it "has taken the
      difficult decision to suspend all <br />
      flights to and from Nigeria, effective 01 September 2022, to limit further
      losses and impact on our operational<br />
      costs that continue to accumulate in the market".
